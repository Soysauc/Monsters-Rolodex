# Monsters Rolodex

This project was an initial React web application that created a Monsters Rolodex. This would have humanoid looking monsters appear
from cards and then have the capability of being searched for and sorted based on those results. This project was a simple one using
React and was inspired by Andrei Neagoie from ZTM.

## Why this project?

I wanted to do a little react project while working on the WTWR application I am doing for Practicum. This would in theory and practice
help me to get more familiar with the technology and therefore create better and larger applications.

### Typescript

Refactored using Typescript. Also changed my classical components over to functional components as is more commonly seen in modern React (because of the prevalence of hooks). Using TS was an inital challenge with its different syntax but I'll continue practicing and eventually use it on an independent creative project.
