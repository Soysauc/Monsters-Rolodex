# Monsters Rolodex

This project was an initial React web application that created a Monsters Rolodex. This would have humanoid looking monsters appear
from cards and then have the capability of being searched for and sorted based on those results. This project was a simple one using
React and was inspired by Andrei Neagoie from ZTM.

## Why this project?

I wanted to do a little react project while working on the WTWR application I am doing for Practicum. This would in theory and practice
help me to get more familiar with the technology and therefore create better and larger applications.
